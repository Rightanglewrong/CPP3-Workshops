I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

The difference between a Functor and a lambda expression is that a Functor is a class/struct that overloads the () operator. 
It allows an object to be called like a function and they are useful for situations where you need to store state within the object.
They can contain member variables and functions, which allow for more operations. While a lambda expression is an anonymous function that can be defined
inline, providing a quick way to define and use functions without the need for a seperately named function object. 
Used for callbacks or as arguments in bigger functions, they allow for short lived functions to be created and used.

In terms of the exception thrown in the SpellChecker constructor, I would have created a boolean flag to track if an error was encountered.
And then based on the boolean flag, I would then send a custom error message to the client side. Or I would create a validator function that
would run and have the response be handled based on the result of the validator. This way would also be reusable in multiple parts of the program.

The Movie and Book classes could be combined under a parent class of Media and the overlaping functionality and variables be brought up to the parent class.

The creation of a default constructor is in my opinion, is beneficial just to have in case one needs to instantiate an instance of Movie or Book.
Without having information places inside yet. Altho our code for this project is more catered for the custom constructor since it reads the file and error handles its opening.
This functionality could be placed into its own function and reused in other parts of the program.

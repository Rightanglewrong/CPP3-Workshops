I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

You do not need to create a .cpp file for Queue because it is a class template, the definition of its members are needed at the point of instantiation. 
The compiler has access to the complete template code and can generate the necessary code for different types and capacities using the Queue class.

In my Dictionary class, I added an equal operator, which returned true when two terms/definitions were the same and false otherwise. This is helpful for when the dictionary entries need to be compared for duplicates later on.
The reason for specializing the push function is to better customize our results to fit our needs. Since floating point values will be hard to match for exact matches.
It is better to check for values within a tolerance level than to look for exact matches. In defining the class variable outside the class definition, we can save/keep a default value for which we can compare or return to.
Overall, I would say that the syntax for templates are somewhat confusing to wrap my head around in some situations especially with all the <> and :: chained together.
